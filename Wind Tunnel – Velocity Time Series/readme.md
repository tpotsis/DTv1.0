## Dynamic Terrain Step 1: Wind tunnel Velocity Time series Database
The DT methodology involves generating and propagating turbulence wind flow representative of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) using time series data extracted from the Concordia Wind Tunnel (Stathopoulos, 1984). These data are located within the "Wind Tunnel – Velocity Time Series" directory. Each file within this directory is named according to the height of the probe in millimeters, with a data output frequency of 1000 Hz and a duration of 23.12 seconds for each of the four experimental data sets. In total, there are 92,480 data for the three wind directions, comprising 4 sets of 23,120 data from each experiment. Figure 3 illustrates the mean, turbulence intensity, and integral length scale profiles of these data. The mean velocity at z=10 m is U=8.6 m/s. The wind profile corresponds to exposure type B as defined in ASCE 49-21.

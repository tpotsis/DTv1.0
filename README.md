Dyncamic Terrain is an inflow turbulence genreation method that utilises wind tunnel velocity time series to model wind flow and wind-induced loads on the ABL via efficient LES.
DT.cpp code is used to generate inflow data based on the timeVaryingMappedFixedValue function of OpenFOAM v2012. 
Data file contains all the important information.

### Step 1. Source of velocity time series
Velocity time series data are found in Wind Tunnel â€“ Velocity Time Series from 22 vertical height in Concordia Wind Tunnel Laboratory.

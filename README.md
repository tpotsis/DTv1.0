Dynamic Terrain is an inflow turbulence generation method that utilises wind tunnel velocity time series to model wind flow and wind-induced loads on the ABL via efficient LES.
DT.cpp code is used to generate inflow data based on the timeVaryingMappedFixedValue function of OpenFOAM v2012. 
Data file contains all the important information.
LES-DT is a four step procedure:
### Step 1. Source of velocity time series
Velocity time series data are found in Wind Tunnel â€“ Velocity Time Series from 22 vertical height in Concordia Wind Tunnel Laboratory. The output frequency is 1000 Hz and total duration of 92.48 s.
### Step 2. Spectral tuning
The inflow frequency is modified according to the computational set up as to account for the filtering of LES after the cut-off frequency. 
This can be modified via the inflow_freqcunecy parameter in Data.
Target is to tune the spectrum of longitudinal velocity with von Karman spectrum after the  cut-off frequency of LES.
### Step 3. Incident flow modification
The scope is to modify the mean and turbulence intensity incident profiles based on the target exposure of the analysis (i.e. open, suburban etc.). The can be done via the options on Data files such as: modification_mean, modification_rms, targetProfileU_directory, targetProfileUrms_directory, results_U0_directory, results_U0rms_directory.
The target is to much mean and turbulence intensity profiles at the incident flow.
Finally, the analyses with the building is run based on the inflow data generated by Step 3.
### Step 4. Pressure time series extraction
The time series from OpenFOAM (probes function) are extracted for each computational times step (CFL <0.4) and read by the PTSE.cpp code. This code receives as an input: target output frequency of time series, mean velocity at the top of the ABL, path of where to write the output. It provides the final pressure times series from selected pressure taps as a matrix.
Documentation and details can be found in [1], [2] and [4].
